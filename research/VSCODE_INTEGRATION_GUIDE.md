### File Type Support

Custom file associations for research artifacts:
- `.lab` files: Python research scripts
- `.research` files: JSON research configurations
- `.analysis` files: Python analysis scripts
- `.cogmodel` files: JSON cognitive model definitions

## Usage Guidelines

### Starting a Research Session

1. Use VSCode task: "Research Lab - Initialize Secure Lab"
2. Start CLI interface: "Research Lab - Start CLI Interface"
3. Create encrypted research session with appropriate security level
4. Load data and begin analysis

### Security Levels

- **RESTRICTED**: Basic security for public research
- **CONFIDENTIAL**: Standard security for sensitive research
- **SECRET**: High security for classified research
- **TOP_SECRET**: Maximum security for highly sensitive research

### Visualization Workflows

1. **Statistical Analysis**: Generate distribution plots, correlation matrices
2. **Behavioral Analysis**: Create timeline visualizations, decision patterns
3. **Cognitive Modeling**: Network graphs, learning progression charts
4. **Temporal Analysis**: Time series, phase transitions, trend analysis

## Best Practices

### Security

1. Always use appropriate security levels for research data
2. Regular security audits using the built-in audit task
3. Encrypted storage for all sensitive research artifacts
4. Session-based access with automatic timeout

### Development

1. Use the debug configurations for component development
2. Leverage Copilot suggestions for research-specific coding
3. Follow the established module structure for extensions
4. Use the CLI interface for batch operations

### Analysis

1. Start with exploratory data analysis using the visualization engine
2. Use the analysis engine for statistical validation
3. Document findings using Jupyter notebooks in the research structure
4. Export results using secure export protocols

## Extension Points

The system supports extension through:

1. **Analysis Plugins**: Custom analysis engines for specific research domains
2. **Visualization Modules**: Additional chart types and visualization engines
3. **Security Modules**: Custom encryption and access control mechanisms
4. **Data Connectors**: Integration with external research databases

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Errors**: Check security level and session permissions
2. **Module Import Issues**: Verify PYTHONPATH configuration in VSCode
3. **Visualization Errors**: Ensure all visualization dependencies are installed
4. **Encryption Issues**: Verify master key generation and storage

### Diagnostic Tools

- System Health Check task for component status
- Security Audit task for compliance verification
- Debug configurations for component-level troubleshooting
- Comprehensive logging in the logs directory

## Performance Optimization

### Configuration

- Adjust containment levels based on security vs. performance requirements
- Use distributed computing options (Dask, Ray) for large-scale analysis
- Configure memory limits for visualization rendering
- Optimize database connections for frequent data access

### Monitoring

- Built-in performance monitoring with psutil integration
- Memory profiling for analysis workflows
- Real-time system health monitoring
- Automated alerts for resource utilization

## Integration with Existing Research

The system is designed to integrate with existing research workflows:

1. **Legacy Data**: Import tools for existing research datasets
2. **Model Integration**: Support for existing cognitive and ML models
3. **Visualization Migration**: Import existing charts and visualizations
4. **Workflow Preservation**: Maintain existing analysis pipelines
