# Research Directory

## Overview

The `research/` directory was initially designed as a standalone workspace for advanced AI research, cognitive simulation, and self-aware system development. However, it has now evolved to align with Artifact's core objectives. While it was previously possible to install and use this directory independently, it is now strongly advised to download the Artifact workspace instead. Artifact is a new program under active development, providing a unified and integrated environment for advanced AI research.

## Purpose

This research environment is designed to:
- Develop and test advanced AI cognitive frameworks
- Implement self-awareness and ethical reasoning systems
- Create modular, extensible AI architectures
- Provide comprehensive monitoring and diagnostics
- Support experimental AI research and development
