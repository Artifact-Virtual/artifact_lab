# Artifact OpenAI Cookbook Examples

This folder contains enterprise-ready examples for using OpenAI models within the Artifact ecosystem. All notebooks are enhanced for robust dataset loading, error handling, and production deployment.

## Key Features

- **Modular Dataset Loading:** Every example demonstrates how to load and validate datasets (text, image, audio, tabular, binary) with robust error handling.
- **Enterprise Patterns:** Workflows are designed for real-world, multi-step, and multi-modal use cases.
- **Security & Compliance:** All code is written with enterprise security and compliance in mind.

## Example Notebooks

- [How to process image and video with GPT-4](how_to_process_image_and_video_with_gpt4o.ipynb): Image and video processing with robust data loading and error handling.
- [How to call functions with chat models](How_to_call_functions_with_chat_models.ipynb): Function calling with validation and error management.
- [Data extraction and transformation](Data_extraction_transformation.ipynb): Data extraction with input validation.
- [How to stream completions](How_to_stream_completions.ipynb): Streaming completions with error handling.
- [Developing Hallucination Guardrails](Developing_hallucination_guardrails.ipynb): Output guardrails and validation.

## Usage

1. Install all dependencies as described in the root README.
2. Open any notebook and follow the step-by-step instructions.
3. All code is ready for enterprise deployment and can be adapted to your organization's needs.
