This folder contains enterprise-ready examples for using LlamaIndex within the Artifact ecosystem. All notebooks are enhanced for robust dataset loading, error handling, and production deployment.

## Key Features

- **Modular Dataset Loading:** Every example demonstrates how to load and validate datasets (text, image, audio, tabular, binary) with robust error handling.
- **Enterprise Patterns:** Workflows are designed for real-world, multi-step, and multi-modal use cases.
- **Security & Compliance:** All code is written with enterprise security and compliance in mind.

## Example Notebooks

- [RAG Getting Started](rag_getting_started.ipynb): Retrieval-augmented generation with robust data loading and error handling.

## Usage

1. Install all dependencies as described in the root README.
2. Open any notebook and follow the step-by-step instructions.
3. All code is ready for enterprise deployment and can be adapted to your organization's needs.
