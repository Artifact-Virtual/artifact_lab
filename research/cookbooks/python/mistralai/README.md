# Artifact Mistral AI Cookbook Examples

This folder contains enterprise-ready examples for using Mistral AI models within the Artifact ecosystem. All notebooks are enhanced for robust dataset loading, error handling, and production deployment.

## Key Features

- **Modular Dataset Loading:** Every example demonstrates how to load and validate datasets (text, image, audio, tabular, binary) with robust error handling.
- **Enterprise Patterns:** Workflows are designed for real-world, multi-step, and multi-modal use cases.
- **Security & Compliance:** All code is written with enterprise security and compliance in mind.

## Example Notebooks

- [Function Calling](function_calling.ipynb): Robust function calling with input validation.
- [Prompting Capabilities](prompting_capabilities.ipynb): Advanced prompting with error handling.
- [Prefix Use Cases](prefix_use_cases.ipynb): Prefix strategies with modular data loading.
- [Evaluation](evaluation.ipynb): Model evaluation with robust error handling.

## Usage

1. Install all dependencies as described in the root README.
2. Open any notebook and follow the step-by-step instructions.
3. All code is ready for enterprise deployment and can be adapted to your organization's needs.
