# Artifact LangChain Cookbooks

This folder contains enterprise-grade examples and patterns for using the LangChain framework within the Artifact ecosystem. All examples are designed to demonstrate best practices for integrating LangChain with Artifact's proprietary tools, workflows, and data infrastructure.

## What is LangChain?

LangChain is a modular framework for building applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It provides tools for prompt engineering, data handling, workflow orchestration, and integration with external APIs and knowledge sources.

## Artifact Integration

- **Unified Data Access:** All examples use Artifact's modular data loaders and hybrid serverless DB for robust, production-ready data handling.
- **Enterprise Workflows:** Patterns are tailored for real-world, multi-step, and multi-modal enterprise use cases.
- **Security & Compliance:** All code is written with enterprise security and compliance in mind.

## Example Notebooks

- [Getting Started with LangChain & Artifact](lc_openai_getting_started.ipynb): How to use LangChain with Artifact's data and models for robust, production-grade LLM workflows.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and install all dependencies as described in the root README.
2. Open any notebook in this folder and follow the step-by-step instructions.
3. All code is ready for enterprise deployment and can be adapted to your organization's needs.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please ensure all new examples:

- Use Artifact's data loaders and DB integrations
- Follow the enterprise security and style guidelines
- Include clear, step-by-step documentation
