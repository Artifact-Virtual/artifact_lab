# Research Queue System

## Overview
The Research Queue is the central dispatching system for all autonomous research activities in the Artifact Virtual ecosystem. This directory manages:

- **Pending Research Topics**: Queue of research items awaiting processing
- **Active Research**: Currently running research investigations  
- **Priority Queue**: High-priority research requests
- **Research Scheduling**: Automated scheduling and resource allocation
- **Research Results**: Output management and distribution

## Critical Components

### Queue Management
- `queue_manager.py` - Core queue management system
- `priority_scheduler.py` - Priority-based research scheduling
- `research_dispatcher.py` - Distributes research tasks to available agents

### Data Structures
- `pending/` - Pending research topics and requests
- `active/` - Currently processing research tasks
- `completed/` - Completed research ready for integration
- `failed/` - Failed research attempts requiring attention

### Integration Points
- Research Lab integration for secure analysis
- Autonomous research pipeline connectivity
- Multi-agent research team coordination
- Real-time research status monitoring

## Security Level: CONFIDENTIAL
All research queue operations are logged and audited for security compliance.
