Artifact Blueprint: Modular Abstraction System for LLMs with Embedding Models

Introduction

This document describes a modular system architecture designed to enhance large language models (LLMs) by integrating embedding models and vector databases. The approach emphasizes separation of concerns, scalability, and extensibility, following artifact-driven engineering best practices.

Design Principles

- Separation of Concerns: Each module is responsible for a specific function—vectorization, context management, or orchestration—minimizing coupling and improving maintainability.
- Central Orchestration: The LLM coordinates the system, delegating specialized tasks to auxiliary components.
- Modularity: Components can be upgraded or replaced independently.
- Extensibility: The system is designed to integrate additional models, APIs, or knowledge sources as needed.

Architecture Overview

User Input flows to the Embedding Model, which transforms input into vector representations. These vectors are stored and queried in the Vector Database. The Context Manager selects and formats relevant context, which is then processed by the LLM (Orchestrator) to generate the System Output.

Component Breakdown

- Embedding Model: Converts user input into vector representations for similarity search.
- Vector Database: Efficiently indexes and retrieves embeddings.
- Context Manager: Selects and formats relevant context for the LLM.
- LLM (Orchestrator): Processes contextualized input and generates output.
- Orchestration Layer (Optional): Manages workflow, logging, and error handling.

Workflow Steps

1. Vectorization: User input is converted to embeddings.
2. Retrieval: Embeddings are used to query the vector database for relevant context.
3. Context Assembly: The context manager prepares data for the LLM.
4. Response Generation: The LLM produces output based on the provided context.
5. Delivery: Output is returned to the user or downstream system.

Artifact Characteristics

- Style: Modular, extensible, and interface-driven.
- Grade: Suitable for research and production prototyping, with a focus on maintainability and scalability.

Extensions & Use Cases

- Integration with external APIs or knowledge bases.
- Support for multiple LLMs or embedding models.
- Advanced context management, such as dynamic memory.
- Use cases include retrieval-augmented question answering, context-aware agents, and domain-specific search.
