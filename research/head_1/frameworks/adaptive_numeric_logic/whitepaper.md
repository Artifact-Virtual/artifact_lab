## Getting Started

### Installation

#### Dependencies
ANF requires several dependencies for its various components. You can install them in one of three ways:

1. **Using pip with requirements.txt**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Using setup.py (recommended)**:
```bash
# Basic installation
pip install .

# With development dependencies
pip install ".[dev]"

# With MPI support
pip install ".[mpi]"
```

3. **Using the dependency checker script**:
```bash
python scripts/check_dependencies.py
```

#### Verifying Installation
To verify all dependencies are correctly installed:
```bash
python scripts/check_dependencies.py
```

This will check for all required packages and their versions, offering to install any missing dependencies.

### Basic Usage

```python
from ui_task_definition.task_object import TaskObject
from ui_task_definition.dsl_parser import DSLParser
from control_orchestration.task_management import TaskScheduler

# Define a task
task_definition = {
    "task_id": "example_task",
    "description": "Sample computation",
    "parameters": {"param1": "value1"},
    "priority": "high"
}

# Parse and execute
parser = DSLParser()
task = parser.parse(task_definition)
scheduler = TaskScheduler()
scheduler.schedule(task)
```

## Advanced Usage Examples
