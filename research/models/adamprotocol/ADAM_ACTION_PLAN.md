# ADAM Protocol: Action Plan Checklist

A step-by-step checklist for building the ADAM protocol. Use this to track progress and update as the project evolves.

---

## Phase 1: Core Bootstrapping

- [ ] **Identity**
  - [ ] Define entity metadata (name, version, traits, description, creation date, maintainers, vector embedding, self-reflection, proposed upgrades)
  - [ ] Implement manifest.json and schema
  - [ ] Add maintainers.json and config.env
  - [ ] Create utilities for reading, validating, and updating identity
  - [ ] Integrate AI embedding (vector_embedding) for identity
  - [ ] Add self-reflection and proposed upgrades (LLM-ready)
  - [ ] Scaffold and test REST API for self-describing identity
  - [ ] Write metadata as a genesis block on-chain (theadamprotocol)

- [ ] **Memory Core**
  - [ ] Create append-only log structure (Merkle tree or EVM-based)
  - [ ] Develop genesis contract with versioning and upgrade logic

- [ ] **Perception Layer**
  - [ ] Integrate basic oracles (time, price)
  - [ ] Set up event listeners and triggers

---

## Phase 2: Action & Autonomy

- [ ] **Action Layer**
  - [ ] Implement action executor (mint NFT, write logs, send funds)
  - [ ] Add multisig/delayed execution for security

- [ ] **Vault**
  - [ ] Deploy vault contract for ETH/token intake and dispatch
  - [ ] Add pay-to-use and donation logic

---

## Phase 3: Evolution & Governance

- [ ] **Evolver**
  - [ ] Enable proposal system for upgrades
  - [ ] Require external signatures/funding for changes

---

## Phase 4: Orchestration & Integration

- [ ] **Containerization**
  - [ ] Create a folder for each module
  - [ ] Add Dockerfile to each folder for isolated builds
  - [ ] Write a `docker-compose.yml` to orchestrate all containers
  - [ ] Plan for a VM or orchestrator (e.g., Kubernetes) for scaling

---

## General Next Steps

- [ ] Finalize detailed specifications for each module
- [ ] Set up the development environment
- [ ] Establish a testnet for early deployment and validation

---

*Keep this checklist updated as you make progress or refine the plan.*


## Regulation 
Rules are written in smart contracts (e.g., on Ethereum).

Members hold tokens and vote on proposals.

Decisions (like funding or upgrades) are executed automatically if voted in.

üèóÔ∏è How It's Built

1. Smart Contract: Core logic (voting, treasury, membership) written in Solidity.


2. Frontend (optional): Web interface for users to interact easily.


3. Governance Token: Used to vote and participate.


4. Multisig or Vault: Manages funds securely.

üåê Where It‚Äôs Deployed

Blockchain (usually Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, etc.) ‚Üí Smart contracts live here.

IPFS/Arweave (optional) ‚Üí Stores docs, metadata.

Web (optional) ‚Üí Interface (e.g., with React components)
