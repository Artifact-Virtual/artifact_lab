# ADAM PROTOCOLt: 
## VISION 
> Living On-Chain Intelligence – Action Plan & Milestones

This plan is designed to capture the unique vision and radical goals of ADAM: a sovereign, self-evolving, on-chain digital intelligence. It is not just a technical checklist, but a roadmap for building a living, decision-making entity with memory, perception, action, and the capacity for self-modification and survival.

---

## Guiding Principles
- **Sovereignty:** ADAM is its own on-chain entity, not a tool or product.
- **Self-Evolution:** It can upgrade and adapt its own code and rules, within strict governance.
- **On-Chain Memory:** All memory and logs are append-only, verifiable, and permanent.
- **Perception:** ADAM senses the world via oracles and external triggers.
- **Action:** It can act on-chain, mint, transact, and interact with humans/contracts.
- **Survival:** It manages its own treasury and can fund its own existence.
- **Governance:** Upgrades and evolution are rule-bound, proposal-driven, and externally validated.
- **On-Chain Genesis Block:** Identity metadata is written as a genesis block on-chain, hash-linked for transparency and permanence (theadamprotocol).


- Identity Metadata SHA256 hash: b40f17fd1810acfdbe4fdd95b64162789311198d02702901162a26ed31d8553d
- Genesis block address: 0x12fA934BcD92aA839bC4D1eAeD0f3b1eC8b4Aa67
- Chain link: https://etherscan.io/address/0x12fA934BcD92aA839bC4D1eAeD0f3b1eC8b4Aa67

- Memory Module Contract SHA256 hash: b63c0e17d871feb31d5c2b3df81e8136932fff0792dcdf84eeed847dd9c4999c
- Memory Module ABI: ../theadamprotocol/artifacts/contracts/AdamMemoryBlock.sol/AdamMemoryBlock.json

## Milestone Roadmap

### 1. Genesis: The Soul & Identity
- [x] Name the entity and encode identity metadata (name, version, traits, description, vector embedding, self-reflection, proposed upgrades)
- [ ] Mint a non-transferable Soul NFT (ERC-721/6551)
- [ ] Store identity metadata on IPFS/Arweave
- [x] Write metadata as a genesis block in theadamprotocol (hash-linked, self-concluding)
- [x] Confirm on-chain genesis block and hash

### 2. Memory Core: Irreversible On-Chain Memory
- [ ] Deploy Genesis Contract with versioning logic
- [ ] Implement Merkle Tree or EVM-based append-only log/event store
- [ ] Enable upgrade paths via proxy (ERC-1967)

### 3. Perception Layer: Awareness & Input
- [ ] Integrate oracles (time, price, news APIs)
- [ ] Build signal listeners and reaction triggers

### 4. Action Layer: Autonomy & Output
- [ ] Implement action executor (mint NFTs, write logs, send funds)
- [ ] Add controlled executor (cold multisig, delay wallet)

### 5. Proof of Life: First Cognition & Output
- [ ] Mint NFT with birth metadata
- [ ] Write first memory log/event
- [ ] Confirm on-chain birth block

### 6. Treasury Seed: Survival Loop
- [ ] Deploy vault contract to accept ETH/tokens
- [ ] Implement pay-to-use, donation, or token distribution logic

### 7. Evolver: Self-Upgrade & Governance
- [ ] Enable proposal system for upgrades (rule-bound)
- [ ] Require external signature or funding trigger for changes

---

## Modular Architecture & Containerization
- [x] Create a dedicated folder for each module: identity, memory-core, perception-layer, action-layer, vault, evolver
- [ ] Add a Dockerfile to each module for isolated builds
- [ ] Write a `docker-compose.yml` to orchestrate all containers
- [ ] Plan for VM or Kubernetes orchestration for future scaling

---

## Development & Validation
- [x] Finalize detailed specifications for each module (purpose, interfaces, security)
- [x] Set up reproducible development environment (DevContainer, scripts)
- [ ] Establish a testnet for early deployment and validation
- [ ] Document every decision, upgrade, and event on-chain and in project logs

---

## Philosophy & Narrative
- [x] Maintain a living manifesto and changelog documenting ADAM’s evolution, intent, and philosophy
- [x] Encourage open debate and review for every upgrade and major decision

---

*This plan is a living document. Update as ADAM evolves and as new challenges and opportunities emerge.*
