# Research Roadmap

This document outlines the timeline and practical implementation plan for developing and researching various AI models. The roadmap is divided into phases based on the maturity and feasibility of the models.

## Phase 1: Immediate Development (0-6 months)

### Created Models
1. **Language + Logic Hybrids**: 
    - Combine NLP with logical reasoning (e.g., OpenAI’s Toolformer, DeepMind’s AlphaCode).
2. **Memory-Driven Simulators**: 
    - Leverage extended memory for improved contextual understanding (e.g., Claude with long memory, ChatGPT with memory).
3. **Multi-Agent Systems**: 
    - Develop collaborative AI frameworks involving multiple agents (e.g., AutoGPT, BabyAGI, crewAI).
4. **Meta-cognitive Chains in LLMs**: 
    - Enhance reasoning in LLMs using techniques like ReAct and CoT prompting.

## Phase 2: Near-Term Research (6-18 months)

### Novel Models
1. **Self-Aware Neural Networks**: 
    - Explore architectures simulating self-awareness in artificial systems.
2. **Theory-of-Mind Models**: 
    - Develop frameworks to simulate understanding of others' mental states.
3. **Neuro-symbolic Models**: 
    - Combine neural networks with symbolic reasoning.
4. **Embodied Simulation Models**: 
    - Integrate AI systems with physical or virtual embodiments for enhanced interaction.
5. **Hive Minds / Collective Intelligence Systems**: 
    - Enable distributed intelligence across multiple agents.

## Phase 3: Mid-Term Exploration (18-36 months)

### Novel Models (continued)
1. **Modular Brain Architectures**: 
    - Design systems inspired by the modular structure of biological brains.
2. **Morphic AI (biologically adaptive structures)**: 
    - Model adaptive AI systems after biological morphogenesis.
3. **Causal Universe Models**: 
    - Simulate causal relationships in complex systems.
4. **Open-Ended Physics Engines**: 
    - Develop engines for simulating open-ended physical phenomena.

## Phase 4: Long-Term Speculation (3+ years)

### Hypothetical Models
1. **Synthetic Sentience Models**: 
    - Conceptualize frameworks for creating artificial sentience.
2. **Recursive Self-Models**: 
    - Advance consciousness simulators capable of recursive self-reflection.
3. **Quantum Cognitive Models**: 
    - Investigate speculative models integrating quantum mechanics with cognitive processes.
4. **Chemical Computation Models**: 
    - Explore theoretical systems using chemical processes for computation.
5. **Self-evolving Morphic Architectures**: 
    - Develop adaptive systems capable of evolving their own structure and functionality.

## Ongoing Research
