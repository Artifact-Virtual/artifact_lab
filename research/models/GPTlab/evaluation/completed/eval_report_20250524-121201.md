# Model Evaluation Report

**Model:** `models/pretrained/model-latest.pt`  
**Evaluation Data:** `models/evaluation`  
**Batch Size:** 64  
**Block Size:** 256  
**Device:** cuda

**Grade:** **C**

## Evaluation Metrics

| Metric      | Value   |
|-------------|---------|
| **Loss**        | 1.5199  |
| **Accuracy**    | 0.5866  |
| **Perplexity**  | 4.5716  |

- **Loss** reflects the average error between predicted and actual outputs; a lower value is better.
- **Accuracy** indicates the proportion of correct predictions; 0.5866 suggests moderate performance.
- **Perplexity** measures how well the model predicts a sample; lower values indicate better language modeling.

## Prompt and Model Output

**Prompt:**  
`what have you learned?`

**Generated Text:**
```
what have you learned?/matry constructions to produce it with maximum-rays or fundamental resultfored-oï¬€ the input: the ma
```

> The generated text demonstrates limited coherence and relevance to the prompt, with apparent issues in fluency and content alignment.

## Auto Grade

**Grade:** **C**

**Reasoning:** The model achieves moderate accuracy (0.5866) but exhibits a relatively high loss and perplexity, indicating that predictions are not consistently reliable. The generated output lacks coherence and fails to provide a meaningful response to the prompt, suggesting the need for further training or model refinement.

## Conclusion

While the model demonstrates some ability to process and generate text, its current performance is insufficient for high-quality, reliable outputs. Improvements in training data, model architecture, or hyperparameter tuning are recommended to enhance accuracy, reduce loss and perplexity, and produce more coherent and contextually appropriate responses.
