║                  STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES (SOP)                       ║
╠════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣

    1. ▶ Always run `./run.sh` from root when you login to the workspace.
    2. ▶ Ensure all dependencies are installed using `npm install`.
    3. ▶ Use `npm start` to launch the application.
    4. ▶ Run tests with `npm test` before committing changes.
    5. ▶ Follow PEP8 guidelines for Python code.
    6. ▶ Always update this file. ALWAYS. No exceptions.
    7. ▶ Perform a full codebase review periodically to ensure no errors exist.
                ▸ Fix all issues, big or small, without workarounds or cutting corners.
    8. ▶ Always validate and fix JSON config files for strict compliance
                ▸ (no trailing commas, valid syntax).
    9. ▶ Ensure all model/provider logic is routed through a single config file (`config.json`).
   10. ▶ Standardize import paths and config resolution for all entry-point scripts.
   11. ▶ ALWAYS UPDATE workspace_manager\config.json with latest updated SOPs (this file).
   12. ▶ LLM must have secure, auditable read/write access to the codebase via backend API.
   13. ▶ LLM should be able to both suggest and directly make codebase changes (with audit trail).
   14. ▶ Backend API must support advanced file/code management (list, read, write, create, delete, search).
   15. ▶ Integrate Monaco Editor in webchat; ensure LLM can trigger Monaco actions (open, edit, diff, save).
   16. ▶ If using vector DB or code store, ensure LLM can utilize for semantic code search and advanced queries.
   17. ▶ All LLM-driven changes must be user-controllable (approve, undo) and meticulously logged.

╠════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
 ✅ PHASE 1 COMPLETE: Backend API for file management implemented and operational
 ✅ Enhanced webchat running on http://localhost:8080 with file operations API
 ✅ File operations audit logging system implemented with secure path validation
 ✅ API endpoints for list, read, write, create, search operations functional
 ✅ LLM has enhanced context awareness of file management capabilities
 ✅ PHASE 2 COMPLETE: Monaco Editor integration for direct code editing
 ✅ Full-featured code editor with syntax highlighting, file explorer, and save functionality
 ✅ LLM interaction logging and audit trail system implemented
 ✅ Enhanced chat interface with file context and code modification capabilities
 🔄 PHASE 3 IN PROGRESS: Advanced LLM code analysis and automated refactoring
 🔄 PHASE 4 PENDING: Vector DB integration for semantic code search (optional)
 • Enhanced webchat now features Monaco Editor with multi-language support
 • File explorer integrated with real-time file operations
 • LLM context enhanced with current file and editor state information
 • Comprehensive audit logging for both file operations and LLM interactions
 • User-controllable interface with save/refresh/navigation functionality
 • Real-time code editing with syntax highlighting for 15+ programming languages
 • Secure file access with path validation and workspace boundary enforcement
 • Config file (`config.json`) is now strictly validated and trailing commas removed.
 • All model/provider logic is routed through a single config file.
 • Import paths and config resolution standardized for all entry-point scripts.
 • System now prevents JSON parsing errors due to invalid config files.
 • Webchat now has ARTIFACT VIRTUAL styling (black AMOLED + fade edges).
 • Enhanced visualizer has tree/heatmap/analysis/metrics views with modern UI,
     real-time charts, and dotfile support.
 • Main launcher gives choice: Enhanced Analytics Visualizer / 3D Node Visualizer
     (starmap removed and cleaned up).
 • Dependency indexer now includes dotfiles and richer file metadata.
 • System cleaned up: no more starmap references, overconfiguration removed,
     only essential visualizers remain.

║                  DEVCORE/WORKSPACE AUTOMATION UPDATES (2025-06)            ║
╠════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣

 • DevCore CLI now supports robust, root-level execution with all imports using
     the `DevCore.` prefix.
 • Scaffolder enhanced to parse tree structures with icons and create all
     directories/files in `DevCore/workspace`.
 • All generated file and directory names are sanitized for Windows compatibility.
 • CodeGenAgent writes generated code to the correct workspace directory,
     matching the scaffolded structure.
 • Spinner added for CLI feedback during pipeline phases.
 • Circular import issues resolved by modularizing Spinner and using correct
     import patterns.
 • CLI now prints the full visual plan and creates a real, matching directory/file structure.
 • Improved error handling for invalid file/directory names and non-path lines in Ollama output.
 • README updated with clear Python CLI usage and available commands.
 • SOP and changelog maintenance enforced as part of workflow.
