║                  STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES (SOP)                       ║
╠════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣

    1. ▶ Always run `./run.sh` from root when you login to the workspace.
    2. ▶ Ensure all dependencies are installed using `npm install`.
    3. ▶ Use `npm start` to launch the application.
    4. ▶ Run tests with `npm test` before committing changes.
    5. ▶ Follow PEP8 guidelines for Python code.
    6. ▶ Always update this file. ALWAYS. No exceptions.
    7. ▶ Perform a full codebase review periodically to ensure no errors exist.
                ▸ Fix all issues, big or small, without workarounds or cutting corners.
    8. ▶ Always validate and fix JSON config files for strict compliance
                ▸ (no trailing commas, valid syntax).
    9. ▶ Ensure all model/provider logic is routed through a single config file (`config.json`).
 10. ▶ Standardize import paths and config resolution for all entry-point scripts.
 11. ▶ ALWAYS UPDATE workspace_manager\config.json with latest updated SOPs (this file).
 12. ▶ LLM must have secure, auditable read/write access to the codebase via backend API.
 13. ▶ LLM should be able to both suggest and directly make codebase changes (with audit trail and user control).
 14. ▶ Backend API must support advanced file/code management (list, read, write, create, delete, search).
 15. ▶ Integrate Monaco Editor in webchat; ensure LLM can trigger Monaco actions (open, edit, diff, save).
 16. ▶ If using vector DB or code store, ensure LLM can utilize for semantic code search and advanced queries.
 17. ▶ All LLM-driven changes must be user-controllable (approve, undo) and meticulously logged.

║                  DEVCORE/WORKSPACE AUTOMATION UPDATES (2025-06)            ║
╠════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣

 • DevCore CLI now supports robust, root-level execution with all imports using
     the `DevCore.` prefix.
 • Scaffolder enhanced to parse tree structures with icons and create all
     directories/files in `DevCore/workspace`.

 • CodeGenAgent writes generated code to the correct workspace directory,
     matching the scaffolded structure.
 • Spinner added for CLI feedback during pipeline phases.
 • Circular import issues resolved by modularizing Spinner and using correct
     import patterns.
 • CLI now prints the full visual plan and creates a real, matching directory/file structure.
 • Improved error handling for invalid file/directory names and non-path lines in Ollama output.
 • README updated with clear Python CLI usage and available commands.
 • SOP and changelog maintenance enforced as part of workflow.
