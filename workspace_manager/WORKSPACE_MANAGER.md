- **Dependencies**: requests (for ollama)
- **Status**: ✅ Production ready

#### Web Interface (`webchat.py`)
- **Purpose**: Web-based chat interface
- **Status**: ✅ Production ready

## Requirements - Minimal and Clean

```
# Core visualization and monitoring
pygame>=2.5.0
watchdog>=3.0.0
requests>=2.31.0
psutil>=5.9.0

# Optional: AI integration
# ollama
```

## Removed Components

### Completely Eliminated:
- ❌ **ALL Starmap functionality** - completely removed
- ❌ `starmap_visualizer.py` - deleted entirely
- ❌ All starmap imports and references
- ❌ Starmap menu options
- ❌ 3D constellation graphics
- ❌ Cosmic effects and animations
- ❌ Particle systems
- ❌ Sparkling effects
- ❌ Laggy graphics components

### Enhanced Components:
- ✅ **Enhanced Visualizer** - completely redesigned with:
  - Advanced real-time charts
  - Gradient backgrounds
  - Modern UI design
  - Better typography
  - Interactive elements
  - Comprehensive metrics

## Architecture Benefits

### Performance Improvements:
1. **Removed Laggy Graphics**: Eliminated all particle effects and cosmic animations
2. **Optimized Rendering**: Modern pygame techniques with hardware acceleration
3. **Efficient Charts**: Smooth animated charts with gradient effects
4. **Clean Code**: Completely rewritten enhanced visualizer

### Enhanced Analytics:
1. **Dotfiles Support**: Now includes .gitignore, .env, .eslintrc, and other important dotfiles
2. **Comprehensive Metrics**: File sizes, modification times, language analysis
3. **Real-time Monitoring**: Live system performance charts
4. **Better Visualization**: Pie charts, gradient fills, modern design

### User Experience:
1. **Simplified Menu**: Clean 2-option menu (Enhanced/3D)
2. **Better Graphics**: Professional-looking charts and gradients
3. **Responsive UI**: Smooth animations and interactions
4. **Comprehensive Data**: Includes all file types and dotfiles

## Usage

### Quick Start:
```bash
cd w:\worxpace\artifact_lab
python -m workspace_manager.main
```

### Menu Options:
1. **Enhanced Metrics Visualizer** - Advanced analytics dashboard (recommended)
2. **3D Node Visualizer** - Classic circular node visualization

### Controls (Enhanced Visualizer):
- **1**: Dashboard view (default)
- **2**: File tree view
- **TAB**: Toggle sidebar
- **Mouse Wheel**: Scroll through content
- **ESC**: Exit

## Troubleshooting

If you see errors like `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'DevCore'` or import issues:
- Always run scripts from the project root (`w:\worxpace\artifact_lab`).
- Or, use the module syntax: `python -m workspace_manager.webchat`.
- The webchat and all scripts now add the project root to `sys.path` automatically, but running from the root is safest.

If you see `Only one usage of each socket address...` or Ollama port errors:
- Ollama may already be running. The startup script now checks for port 11434 before starting Ollama.
- If you still see issues, kill any existing Ollama processes or free up port 11434.
