  "summary": "This codebase is a sample implementation of an AI assistant using the DevCore framework. It includes various agents that perform different tasks such as NLP preprocessing, file generation, and testing. The `DevCore` module provides a set of tools for building and running AI assistants, including support for integrating with external services like Ollama.\n\nThe `AutoLoopAgent` is a special agent that runs multiple times in an attempt to generate code that passes tests. This is useful because some AI models can produce incorrect or incomplete code that fails the test, but still pass the model. The `CodeGenAgent` generates code for the files specified in the context dictionary using Ollama's query_model function.\n\nThe `ScaffolderAgent` creates a file structure based on the task description provided by the user. It uses Ollama to generate the plan and then converts it into a file structure with proper directories and filenames. The agent also creates a stub for any files that do not have an extension or are known to be non-code files (such as READMEs).\n\nThe `TestAgent` runs the tests specified in the context dictionary using Ollama's query_model function. If no test is provided, it returns None. The agent also provides a summary of the errors that occurred during testing."
