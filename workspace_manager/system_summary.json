  "summary": "This codebase appears to be a command-line interface (CLI) tool called \"DevCore\" that automates the process of building projects. It consists of several Python files and modules, each with specific functionalities related to NLP preprocessing, file generation, testing, and more.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key components:\n\n1. **OLLAMA Interface (`ollama_interface.py`)**:\n   - Contains a function `query_ollama(prompt: str, model: str = \"codellama:7b\") -> str`: This function uses the OLLAMA API to generate responses based on prompts.\n\n2. **Main CLI Script (`cli.py`)**:\n   - Imports and configures modules from the `DevCore` directory.\n   - Handles user input for project descriptions.\n   - Runs a pipeline of agents (Scaffolder, CodeGen, TestAgent) to plan a file structure, generate code, and run tests.\n   - Uses a spinner class (`Spinner`) to provide visual feedback during processing.\n\n3. **Agents (`agents` directory)**:\n   - **ScaffolderAgent**: Plans a file structure for the project based on the user's task description.\n   - **CodeGenAgent**: Generates code for files specified in the context using OLLAMA.\n   - **TestAgent**: Compiles Python files in the workspace to check for syntax errors.\n   - **AutoLoopAgent**: Attempts to fix failing tests by retrying code generation up to a certain number of times.\n\n4. **Base Agent Class (`base_agent.py`)**:\n   - Provides a template for other agents, ensuring they have a `run` method that takes a context dictionary as input.\n\n5. **Spinner Class (`spinner.py`)**:\n   - A simple class to display a spinning animation during long-running processes.\n\nThe main functionality of the CLI is encapsulated in the `run_pipeline` function, which orchestrates the execution of different agents to complete the project build process. The pipeline includes steps for planning structure, generating code, and running tests, with appropriate feedback provided through spinners and print statements."
