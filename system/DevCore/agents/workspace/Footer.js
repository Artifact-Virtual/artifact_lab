Here is an example of what the `Footer.js` file might look like for a note-keeping tool:
```
import React from 'react';
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';

function Footer() {
  const notes = useSelector((state) => state.notes);

  return (
    <footer className="footer">
      <div className="container">
        <h1>Footer</h1>
        <p>This is the footer of our note-keeping tool.</p>
        {notes.length > 0 && (
          <ul>
            {notes.map((note) => (
              <li key={note.id}>{note.title}</li>
            ))}
          </ul>
        )}
      </div>
    </footer>
  );
}

export default Footer;
```
This code imports the `React` and `useSelector` functions from the `react-redux` library, and defines a component called `Footer`. The component uses the `useSelector` hook to get access to the `notes` array from the Redux store. It then renders a footer element with some text and a list of notes that have been added to the store.

You can use this code as a starting point for your own implementation, and adjust it as needed to fit the specific requirements of your application.
