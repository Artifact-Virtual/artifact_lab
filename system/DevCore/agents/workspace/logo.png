Here's an example of how you can create a simple note-keeping tool using Python and the Tkinter library:
```
import tkinter as tk

root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Note Keeper")
root.geometry("300x250")

# Create a text entry field for notes
note_entry = tk.Text(root, height=10)
note_entry.pack()

# Create a button to save the note
save_button = tk.Button(root, text="Save", command=lambda: save_note())
save_button.pack()

def save_note():
    # Get the text from the entry field
    note = note_entry.get("1.0", "end-1c")
    print(f"Note saved: {note}")

root.mainloop()
```
This code creates a window with a text entry field for entering notes and a button to save the note. When the user clicks the button, the `save_note` function is called, which gets the text from the entry field using the `get` method of the `Text` widget, and then prints it to the console.

You can customize this code by adding more features such as a way to view or delete notes, or by using a different database for storing the notes instead of just printing them to the console.
