# Quantum Engine Project

## Overview
The Quantum Engine is a modular framework designed to facilitate the integration and execution of quantum simulations across various backends. This project aims to provide a unified interface for different quantum computing platforms, enabling researchers and developers to leverage quantum technologies effectively.

## Directory Structure
The project is organized into several key directories:

- **core/**: Contains the main components of the quantum engine, including backends, abstraction layers, and interfaces.
- **modules/**: Houses specific implementations for various quantum simulation types, such as quantum chemistry and quantum machine learning.
- **virtualization/**: Includes configurations for running simulations in isolated environments using Firecracker microVMs and Docker containers.
- **observability/**: Contains configurations for monitoring and telemetry to ensure the performance and reliability of the quantum engine.
- **automation/**: Provides tools for automating quantum tasks and job scheduling.
- **security/**: Implements security measures, including policies for secrets management and firewall rules.
- **ai/**: Integrates AI capabilities for enhancing quantum task automation and optimization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have the necessary programming languages and tools installed:
  - Rust
  - Python
  - Go
  - Node.js
  - Nix (for reproducible builds)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd quantum-engine
   ```

2. Install dependencies for each language:
   - For Rust:
     ```
     cargo build
     ```
   - For Python:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - For Node.js:
     ```
     npm install
     ```
   - For Go:
     ```
     go mod tidy
     ```

### Usage
- To run simulations, use the provided interfaces (GraphQL, gRPC, REST) to interact with the quantum backends.
- Each module in the `modules/` directory can be executed independently for specific simulation tasks.
