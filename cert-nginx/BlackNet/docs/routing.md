# Routing Mechanisms in Blacknet

## Overview
This document outlines the routing mechanisms employed in the Blacknet project, focusing on the core principles of anonymity, efficiency, and resilience. The routing architecture is designed to ensure secure and private communication across the network.

## Routing Layers
Blacknet utilizes a multi-layered routing approach to enhance privacy and performance:

1. **Onion Routing Layer**: 
   - Implements layered encryption to obscure the source and destination of packets.
   - Each node in the routing path only knows the previous and next node, ensuring anonymity.

2. **Mixnet Layer**: 
   - Provides message mixing and batching to further obfuscate traffic patterns.
   - Supports pluggable delay strategies to prevent traffic analysis.

3. **Session Management**: 
   - Employs ephemeral key exchanges for each tunnel session.
   - Keys are rotated per stream/session to enhance security.

## Routing Protocols
The routing protocols used in Blacknet are designed to support dynamic and adaptive routing:

- **Dynamic Routing**: 
  - Routes are adjusted based on real-time network conditions to optimize performance and reliability.
  
- **Policy-Based Routing**: 
  - Allows users to define routing policies based on application requirements, such as prioritizing certain types of traffic.

## Conclusion
The routing mechanisms in Blacknet are integral to achieving the project's goals of providing scalable, low-latency, and censorship-resistant anonymity. By leveraging advanced routing techniques and protocols, Blacknet aims to create a robust and secure networking environment.
