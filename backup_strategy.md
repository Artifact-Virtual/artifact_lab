Comprehensive Backup Strategy
Full Workspace Backup:
Before any major change, create a full backup (archive) of the entire workspace, including all files, configs, and hidden files.
Incremental Backups:
Schedule regular incremental backups during active development, especially before/after large file operations.
Offsite/Cloud Copy:
Store at least one backup offsite or in the cloud for disaster recovery.
2. Version Control Best Practices
Commit Early, Commit Often:
Commit all changes frequently with descriptive messages.
Branching:
Use feature branches for all refactoring or restructuring. Never work directly on main/master.
Tagging:
Tag stable points (e.g., before/after major refactors) for easy rollback.
3. Large File Handling
Git LFS (Large File Storage):
Use Git LFS or similar tools for versioning large files to avoid repository bloat and corruption.
Checksum Verification:
Generate and store checksums (e.g., SHA256) for all large files before and after operations to verify integrity.
Atomic Operations:
Use atomic file operations (write to temp, then move/rename) to prevent partial writes.
4. Automated Data Integrity Checks
Pre/Post-Refactor Scripts:
Run scripts to verify file counts, sizes, and checksums before and after any bulk operation.
Automated Tests:
Include tests that verify the presence and integrity of critical data files.
5. Safe Refactoring & Migration
Dry Runs:
For any bulk move/rename, perform a dry run and review the plan before executing.
Transactional Changes:
Where possible, script changes so they can be rolled back if an error occurs.
Manual Verification:
After changes, manually verify that all large and critical files are present and uncorrupted.
6. Access Control & Concurrency
Locking:
Lock large or critical files during operations to prevent concurrent writes or accidental deletion.
User Permissions:
Restrict write/delete permissions to trusted users during sensitive operations.
7. Logging & Audit Trails
Operation Logging:
Log all file operations (move, delete, rename, copy) with timestamps and user info.
Audit Review:
Periodically review logs for unexpected changes or anomalies.
8. Disaster Recovery Plan
Restore Drills:
Regularly test restoring from backup to ensure recovery procedures work and backups are valid.
Rollback Procedures:
Document and automate rollback steps for all major changes.
9. Communication & Documentation
Change Announcements:
Notify all team members before major file operations.
Update Documentation:
Keep all data handling and recovery documentation up to date.
