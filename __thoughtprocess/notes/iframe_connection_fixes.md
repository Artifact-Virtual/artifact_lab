# ADE-Desktop Iframe Connection Fixes

## Issue Resolved
- **Problem**: Loading progress would reach 100%, then roll back to 60% and get stuck at 95%
- **Root Cause**: Race condition between progress simulation, connection testing, and iframe loading

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Progress Simulation Improvements
- Added `progressInterval` tracking to prevent multiple intervals running simultaneously
- Reduced step timing from 1500ms to 1000ms for faster loading
- Added proper cleanup of intervals when connection succeeds

### 2. Iframe Connection Logic
- Added state checking to prevent multiple connection attempts
- Implemented proper timeout handling (8 seconds instead of 10)
- Added iframe timeout tracking with `iframeTimeout` variable
- Improved iframe event handlers to check loading state before triggering success

### 3. Connection Testing
- Enhanced `testConnection()` with proper HTTP HEAD request
- Added fallback to iframe-based connection checking
- Implemented timeout handling for fetch requests
- Added better error handling and logging

### 4. State Management
- Added proper cleanup of timers in `onConnectionSuccess()`
- Enhanced `retryConnection()` to reset all state variables
- Improved iframe loading with small delay to ensure readiness
- Added cross-origin error handling (expected behavior)

### 5. Key Changes Made
```javascript
// Added timer tracking
this.progressInterval = null;
this.iframeTimeout = null;

// Improved connection success handler
onConnectionSuccess() {
    // Clear any lingering intervals/timeouts
    if (this.progressInterval) clearInterval(this.progressInterval);
    if (this.iframeTimeout) clearTimeout(this.iframeTimeout);
    // ... rest of success logic
}

// Enhanced iframe event handling
iframe.addEventListener('load', () => {
    if (this.isLoading) {  // Only trigger if still loading
        this.onConnectionSuccess();
    }
});
```

## Current Status
- ✅ Services start correctly (Ollama on 11500, ADE on 9000)
- ✅ Progress simulation no longer gets stuck
- ✅ Iframe loads properly with bezelless design
- ✅ Connection state is properly managed
- ✅ No more race conditions in loading process
- ✅ Proper cleanup of timers and intervals

## Testing Results
- Backend services detected and running
- Electron app starts successfully
- Loading progress completes smoothly
- Iframe integration works with cross-origin handling
- UI remains responsive throughout loading process

## Files Modified
- `ADE-Desktop/renderer/renderer.js` - Main fixes applied
- `ADE-Desktop/renderer/styles.css` - Removed old webview references
- Connection flow now properly handles iframe-based IDE embedding
