PHASE 0: MASTER PLAN SNAPSHOT
We'll divide the project into 8 major modular phases, each with strong deliverables.

Phase 1: Core Quantum Backend Integration (Multi-language)
Objective:
Build the foundational Quantum Abstraction Layer that supports all known major quantum backends, including:

- IBM Qiskit
- Google Cirq
- Rigetti PyQuil
- Braket (AWS)
- QuTiP (open quantum dynamics)
- PennyLane (QML)
- TensorFlow Quantum
- Strawberry Fields (quantum optics)
- Rust-based simulators (via qcgpu, qoqo)
- Julia + Yao.jl
- Go-QSim bridge
- Solidity interface via quantum verifiers (ZK/QASM)

Deliverables:

Full quantum backend engine

Execution router written in Rust

Bindings for Go, Python, Solidity

Universal format: OpenQASM 3 + JSON for state interchange

Phase 2: Virtualization Layer (Hypervisor-Level)
Objective:
Run simulations inside Firecracker microVMs or Kata Containers, using:

Nix-based images for reproducibility

Secure KVM-level isolation for each job

GPU-accelerated JAX or CUDA per VM

Optional per-language hypervisor forks

Tools:
Firecracker (Rust-based)

Containerd + Nix

QEMU for legacy support

Unikernels (optional for high speed)

Phase 3: Full Observability & Monitoring Stack
Stack:
Prometheus + Grafana for metrics

OpenTelemetry for tracing each simulation

Falco or AppArmor for runtime security policies

Elastic + Kibana (optional for logs)

Metrics to Track:

Backend latency

State fidelity vs theoretical

Container/microVM performance

Memory pressure + simulation heatmaps

Phase 4: Ollama AI Assistant Integration
Objective:
Train or fine-tune Ollama to:

Autogenerate QASM or QIR code

Detect optimization opportunities

Suggest alternate backends or hybrid solutions

Write smart simulation descriptions → real jobs

Tooling:
Ollama + Fine-tuned LLaMA 3

LangChain to wrap automation flows

Embedding database of quantum methods (e.g., Pinecone or Weaviate)

Phase 5: Full Automation via Windmill + Headless Control
Rebuild Windmill headlessly, integrate:

Scheduling

Job templates per simulation type

GitOps-based job runner

Trigger Ollama → fetch from Airtable/DB → run job → post results

We’ll design an orchestration engine with:

yaml
Copy
Edit
on_job:
    backend: 'qiskit'
    method: 'vqe'
    hypervisor: 'firecracker'
    ai_optimize: true

Phase 6: Hardened Security Layer
Secure secrets store (Vault)

Firewall + encryption between containers

Wasm-based sandboxing for Solidity interface

Seccomp + AppArmor profiles

Blockchain-integrated verification (ZK proof or L2 call audit)

Phase 7: Simulation Optimizer Engine (Faster Than Quantum)
Use:

Tensor slicing + batched JAX ops

Variational rewriting with AI suggestions

Lattice clock time sync

Pre-cached noise models

FPGA or GPU path for native performance

Phase 8: Expand to All Simulation Types
