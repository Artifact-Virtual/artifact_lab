# Project: Blacknet 
## Overview
Blacknet is a next-generation privacy-focused, programmable networking protocol combining onion routing, mixnets, and zk-SNARK-based identity validation. It aims to provide scalable, low-latency, censorship-resistant IP-level anonymity while supporting clearnet access, SNApp hosting, and quantum-resistant cryptography.

## Features
- **Transport Layer**: Utilizes UDP-over-QUIC with fallback to TCP over TLS 1.3.
- **Routing Stack**: Incorporates onion routing and mixnet layers for enhanced privacy.
- **Identity Layer**: Employs zk-SNARK identity proofs for secure identity validation.
- **Node Architecture**: Supports multiple node roles including relay, mix, exit, and SNApp host.
- **Developer Platform**: Provides an SDK for building decentralized applications.
